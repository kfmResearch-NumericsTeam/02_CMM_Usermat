Here are a few example of ADPL scripts for ansys. It's not the easiest language to read.

I have also created a markdown file where I explain a bit what is inside these script files. The input file studied for this case is the cantilever beam with a surface load. I have either add inline comments or comments before the code blocks.

I also join the documentation found on Ansys website. If you want to access these resources, create an account on https://support.ansys.com/portal/site/AnsysCustomerPortal
